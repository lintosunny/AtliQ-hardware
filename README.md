## Business Model
AtliQ Hardware is a computer hardware manufacturer operating under a B2B2C model, producing laptops, printers, and accessories that reach consumers through multiple channels.

Products are shipped from manufacturing facilities to central warehouses, and then distributed to two main customer types:
- Physical Stores (Brick & Mortar): e.g., Croma, Best Buy, Staples
- E-commerce Platforms: e.g., Amazon, Flipkart

AtliQ sells through three primary channels:
- Retail Channel: Partner retailers like Amazon and Best Buy.
- Direct Channel: AtliQ’s own e-store and exclusive retail outlets.
- Distributor Channel: Regional distributors (e.g., Neptune) who supply retailers that sell to end consumers.

This multi-channel strategy enables AtliQ to optimize distribution, strengthen brand reach, and maximize revenue through both B2B partnerships and direct consumer engagement.
