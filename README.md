# AtliQ-hardware

## Problem Statement
As a Data Analyst at AtliQ Hardware, my objective is to develop a product sales analysis aggregated at the product level.

This analysis will enable the Product Owner to gain clear visibility into product and variant performance, identify sales trends over time, and conduct deeper product-level analysis within Excel for data-driven decision-making.

## Business Model
AtliQ Hardware is a computer hardware manufacturer operating under a B2B2C model, producing laptops, printers, and accessories that reach consumers through multiple channels.

Products are shipped from manufacturing facilities to central warehouses, and then distributed to two main customer types:
- Physical Stores (Brick & Mortar): e.g., Croma, Best Buy, Staples
- E-commerce Platforms: e.g., Amazon, Flipkart

AtliQ sells through three primary channels:
- Retail Channel: Partner retailers like Amazon and Best Buy.
- Direct Channel: AtliQ’s own e-store and exclusive retail outlets.
- Distributor Channel: Regional distributors (e.g., Neptune) who supply retailers that sell to end consumers.

This multi-channel strategy enables AtliQ to optimize distribution, strengthen brand reach, and maximize revenue through both B2B partnerships and direct consumer engagement.
